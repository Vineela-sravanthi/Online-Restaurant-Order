# Online-Restaurant-Order


My project will be an Online Food order that will allow users to order food online by selecting the items in menu,
add them to cart,place an order and allow admin to check the orders placed by the users, Add what time the order will 
be ready for that user. The admin will be able to login,see the orders from all users and enter pickup time and 
remove the orders after users picked up their orders. The users will be able to create an account,login,select menu 
items to add to an order,edit and remove the order and see the pickup time.
